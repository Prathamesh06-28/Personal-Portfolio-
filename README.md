# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is a custom-built website that showcases my projects, skills, and experiences as a Computer Science and Biochemistry student at Western Michigan University.

## About This Project

I built this portfolio from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to create something that reflects my personality and interests, so I went with a cozy, pixel-art inspired design that changes dynamically based on the current season.

## How I Built It

### Structure & Design

The website is built with a clean, single-page layout that includes:

- **Fixed Navigation Bar**: A sleek, glassmorphic navbar that stays at the top while scrolling, with smooth scroll animations to different sections
- **Hero Section**: Features a dynamic background that changes based on the current season (spring, summer, fall, or winter), with rotating text that cycles through my different roles
- **About Section**: A personal introduction with a pixel-art style avatar
- **Projects Section**: Showcases my work including Unity AI games, VR/XR research, DNA extraction lab work, and this very website
- **Skills Section**: Organized into categories (Programming, Technical, Soft Skills, Languages)
- **Activities Section**: Highlights my hobbies and extracurricular activities
- **Contact Section**: Includes a contact form and links to my email, LinkedIn, and GitHub

### Key Features

**Seasonal Theme System**
- The website automatically detects the current season based on the date
- Background images and color schemes change to match spring, summer, fall, or winter
- Each season has its own curated pixel-art background image
- A season indicator badge appears in the hero section

**Interactive Elements**
- Rotating text animation in the hero section that cycles through: "Researcher", "AI Engineer", "Frontend Dev", and "Gamer"
- Smooth scroll navigation between sections
- Fade-in animations when sections come into view (using Intersection Observer API)
- Hover effects on cards and buttons for better interactivity
- Responsive mobile menu with hamburger icon

**Responsive Design**
- Fully responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Mobile-optimized navigation with a hamburger menu
- Adaptive grid layouts that adjust to different screen sizes

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and accessibility
- **CSS3**: 
  - Custom properties (CSS variables) for theming
  - Flexbox and Grid for layouts
  - Backdrop filters for glassmorphic effects
  - Smooth transitions and animations
  - Media queries for responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**:
  - Season detection logic
  - Text rotation animations
  - Smooth scrolling functionality
  - Mobile menu toggle
  - Intersection Observer for scroll animations
  - Form handling

### Design Philosophy

I wanted this portfolio to feel warm and inviting, like a cozy digital space. The pixel-art aesthetic reflects my interest in game development, while the seasonal theming adds a dynamic, living quality to the site. The color palette uses soft, muted tones that are easy on the eyes, and the glassmorphic design elements give it a modern, polished look.

### File Structure

```
├── Prath.html          # Main HTML file
├── styles.css          # All styling and theming
├── script.js           # Interactive functionality
└── [season images]     # Background images for each season
```

## Future Improvements

I'm always looking to improve this portfolio. Some ideas I have:

- Add more interactive animations
- Implement a dark mode toggle
- Add project filtering/categorization
- Integrate a backend for the contact form
- Add a blog section
- Include more detailed project pages
